# FocusQuest: Current Project State Explanation

## What is FocusQuest?

FocusQuest is an ADHD-optimized mathematics learning application that transforms Hebrew PDF textbooks from Tel Aviv University into an interactive, gamified learning experience. The system is specifically designed for students with ADHD, breaking down complex math problems into manageable steps with AI-powered assistance.

## Where We Are Now (June 3, 2025)

### Project Phase: 7 - Integration & Testing
We have just completed the core integration work that connects all the major components of the system. The application is now functionally complete but requires stability and performance testing.

### What Has Been Built

#### 1. **PDF Processing System**

  - Handles Hebrew text and mathematical formulas
  - Identifies problem boundaries
  - Preserves LaTeX formatting
  - Page-by-page processing

#### 2. **AI Analysis Engine**
- **Location**: `src/analysis/claude_analyzer.py`
- **Function**: Uses Claude AI to analyze and break down problems
- **Features**:
  - Creates 3-7 step solutions for each problem
  - Generates 3-tier hint system
  - Adapts to user's ADHD profile
  - Circuit breaker for API resilience

#### 3. **File Watching System**
- **Location**: `src/core/file_watcher.py`, `src/ui/file_watcher_integration.py`
- **Function**: Monitors inbox folder for new PDFs
- **Features**:
  - Automatic PDF detection
  - Background processing queue
  - Thread-safe operation
  - Pause/resume for breaks

#### 4. **Database Layer**
- **Location**: `src/database/`
- **Function**: Stores all user data and progress
- **Features**:
  - User profiles and progress tracking
  - Problem storage with metadata
  - Session management
  - Achievement system

#### 5. **User Interface**
- **Location**: `src/ui/`
- **Function**: ADHD-optimized GUI
- **Features**:
  - Dark theme for reduced eye strain
  - Single-focus problem display
  - XP/leveling gamification
  - Panic button (Ctrl+P)
  - Skip without shame
  - Break reminders

#### 6. **Integration Components** (Just Completed)
- **State Synchronizer**: `src/core/state_synchronizer.py`
  - Syncs UI state with database
  - Auto-saves every 30 seconds
  - Crash recovery
  
- **Pipeline Integration**: `src/core/pipeline_integration.py`
  - Orchestrates PDF → Analysis → Display flow
  - Error handling at each step
  
- **Problem Monitor**: `src/core/problem_monitor.py`
  - Detects completed AI analyses
  - Feeds problems to UI queue

## How It All Works Together

```
1. User drops PDF in 'inbox' folder
   ↓
2. File watcher detects new PDF
   ↓
3. PDF processor extracts math problems
   ↓
4. Each problem sent to Claude AI for analysis
   ↓
5. AI breaks down problem into steps with hints
   ↓
6. Results saved to database
   ↓
7. Problem monitor detects completion
   ↓
8. Main window loads problem
   ↓
9. User solves step-by-step with gamification
   ↓
10. Progress auto-saved to database
```

## Current Capabilities

### ✅ What Works Now
- Complete PDF to problem display pipeline
- AI-powered problem analysis
- Database persistence of all progress
- ADHD-optimized UI with gamification
- Crash recovery and auto-save
- Background processing without blocking UI
- Circuit breaker for API failures
- Session management with breaks

### ⏳ What Needs Testing
- 4-hour stability for hyperfocus sessions
- Performance with large PDFs
- Memory usage over time
- Crash recovery scenarios

### ❌ Known Issues
- Test coverage at 75% (target 85%)
- 17 failing tests (mock configuration issues)
- Some model field mismatches in tests

## How to Use It

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   python src/main_with_watcher.py
   ```

2. **Drop a Hebrew math PDF** in the `inbox/` folder

3. **Wait for processing** (shows in window title)

4. **Solve problems** step-by-step with hints

5. **Take breaks** when reminded (every 45 minutes)

6. **Use panic mode** (Ctrl+P) if overwhelmed

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **GUI**: PyQt6 (dark theme)
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy
- **AI**: Claude API via CLI (free with Pro)
- **PDF**: pdfplumber + pytesseract
- **Testing**: pytest with 75% coverage

## ADHD Optimizations

1. **Single Focus**: One problem, one screen
2. **Time Boxing**: 3-10 minute chunks
3. **Instant Feedback**: <100ms UI response
4. **Visual Progress**: XP bar always visible
5. **No Shame Skipping**: Skip with encouragement

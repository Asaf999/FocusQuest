Generated: 2025-01-06T00:30:00Z

## Current Features Audit

### Implemented Well ✅
- **Single-Step Focus**: Only current step visible, preventing overwhelm
- **Dark Theme**: Reduces sensory overload and eye strain
- **Keyboard Navigation**: F for focus mode, Space for hints, minimal mouse needed
- **Immediate Rewards**: 10 XP per step provides dopamine hits at right intervals
- **Time Estimates**: 3-10 minute chunks match ADHD attention spans
- **Visual Progress**: XP bar and level progression provide tangible advancement

### Needs Improvement ⚠️
- **Break Reminders**: Timer exists but no actual notifications → Need popup/sound alerts
- **Session Timer**: Shows time but doesn't enforce breaks → Add mandatory pause at 25 min
- **Hint System**: Only 3 levels → Need adaptive hints based on struggle time
- **Error Messages**: Generic failures → Need encouraging, specific feedback

### Critical Gaps ❌

#### 1. Panic Button (CRITICAL)
**Missing**: No immediate overwhelm escape
- **User Story**: As an ADHD student, when I feel panic rising, I need instant relief
- **Implementation**: Global ESC+P shortcut to pause everything, show calming screen
- **Impact**: Users currently forced to close app, losing all progress

#### 2. Energy Level Tracking (HIGH)
**Missing**: No adaptation to user state
- **User Story**: As an ADHD student, my capacity varies greatly by time/day/medication
- **Implementation**: Quick 1-5 energy check at session start, adjust difficulty
- **Database Ready**: focus_level field exists but unused

#### 3. Medication Reminders (HIGH)
**Missing**: Feature in database but no UI
- **User Story**: As an ADHD student, I need reminders for my medication schedule
- **Implementation**: Optional notification at user-set times
- **Database Ready**: medication_reminder boolean exists

#### 4. Bad Day Mode (HIGH)
**Missing**: No accommodation for low-function days
- **User Story**: As an ADHD student, some days I can only handle basics
- **Implementation**: "Easy mode" with simpler problems, more breaks, extra encouragement

#### 5. Skip/Defer Options (MEDIUM)
**Missing**: Stuck on hard problems
- **User Story**: As an ADHD student, being stuck creates anxiety spirals
- **Implementation**: "Come back later" button, problem queuing system

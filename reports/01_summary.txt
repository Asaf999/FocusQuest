Key findings from architecture analysis:
- CRITICAL: Thread safety bug in FileWatcher - can lose PDFs
- CRITICAL: No crash recovery - devastating for ADHD users
- HIGH: Memory leak in ProblemLoader - app slows over time
- Must fix before Phase 7: Thread safety, crash recovery, memory leaks
- Architecture too tightly coupled for easy Claude API integration

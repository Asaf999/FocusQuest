ADHD gaps requiring immediate attention:
- NO PANIC BUTTON - users forced to crash-quit when overwhelmed
- Break reminders exist but don't actually notify - hyperfocus risk
- Medication reminder in database but no UI - wasted feature
- No skip option - anxiety spirals when stuck on problems
- No "bad day mode" - excludes users on low-function days
Combined with Section 1: Thread safety + crash recovery + ADHD panic = CRITICAL

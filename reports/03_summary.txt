Performance & resilience critical issues:
- Memory leaks: PIL images, unbounded cache, session dirs never cleaned
- No graceful shutdown: Ctrl+C loses data, resources leak
- No memory monitoring: Can OOM under load
- No circuit breaker: Claude failures waste resources
- Resource cleanup only in finally blocks: Hard crashes leak
Must fix: Signal handlers, bounded caches, memory checks, circuit breaker

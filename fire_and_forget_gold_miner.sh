PHASE 7 TESTING CYCLE $i

Target: $TARGET_NAME
Description: $TARGET_DESC
Time: 45 minutes
Focus: Testing and Stabilization (NO NEW FEATURES)

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Fix failing tests (17 remaining)
2. Increase coverage (75% â†’ 85%)
3. Validate stability
4. Document results

For TEST_FIXING:
- Run: pytest tests/ --lf -x -v
- ultrathink about the failure
- Fix mock configuration issues
- Verify fix doesn't break others

For COVERAGE_IMPROVEMENT:
- Run: coverage report --show-missing
- Find uncovered code paths
- Write tests for them
- Focus on error handling

For STABILITY_VALIDATION:
- Run progressively longer tests
- Monitor memory usage
- Check for resource leaks
- Document any issues

REMEMBER: No new features in Phase 7!

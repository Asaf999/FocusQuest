# FocusQuest Master Development Plan

## Project Status: PHASE 1 COMPLETE ✅
**Start Date**: January 6, 2025  
**Target MVP**: 4 weeks  
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Processing
**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/Asaf999/FocusQuest

## Vision
Create an ADHD-optimized math learning RPG that automatically processes Hebrew mathematics PDFs from Tel Aviv University courses, analyzes problems using Claude Code, and presents them in a gamified, focus-friendly interface.

- Mathematical formula preservation
- Automated file watching and processing

### Milestone 2: Problem Analysis System
**Target**: End of Week 2
- Claude Code integration for problem analysis
- Reliable Hebrew → English translation
- Problem difficulty assessment

### Milestone 3: Gamification Core
**Target**: End of Week 3

- Achievement unlocking
- Progress persistence

### Milestone 4: Playable MVP
**Target**: End of Week 4
- Complete user flow from PDF → processed problems
- Basic but functional UI
- Core ADHD optimizations implemented

## Success Metrics
- PDF processing accuracy: >95%
- Problem analysis success rate: >90%
- User session length: 15-30 minutes (ADHD-optimal)
- Time to process single problem: <10 seconds
- Memory footprint: <500MB

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Hebrew OCR Challenges**
   - Fallback: Manual correction interface
   - Mitigation: Multiple OCR engines

2. **Mathematical Formula Extraction**
   - Fallback: LaTeX template matching
   - Mitigation: Pre-built formula database

3. **Claude Code API Limits**
   - Fallback: Local caching system
   - Mitigation: Batch processing

4. **i3/PyQt6 Compatibility**
   - Fallback: Terminal UI option
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing on Arch

## Current TODO Priority (Phase 4)
1. ✅ ~~Complete environment setup~~
2. ✅ ~~Implement basic PDF text extraction~~
3. ✅ ~~Test Hebrew processing capabilities~~
4. ✅ ~~Design database schema~~
5. ✅ ~~Create initial test suite~~
6. Create Claude AI integration for problem analysis
7. Design ADHD-optimized prompts for step generation
8. Set up PDF watcher on inbox directory
9. Create Hebrew → English translation pipeline
